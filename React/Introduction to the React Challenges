React, popularized by Facebook, is a open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. With JSX, it is used to create components, handle state and props, utilize event listeners and certain life cycle methods to update data as it changes. React combines HTML with JavaScript functionality to create its own markup language, JSX.
